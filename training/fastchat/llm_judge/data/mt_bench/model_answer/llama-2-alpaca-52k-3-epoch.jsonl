It is usually expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. For example, if you flip a coin, the probability of heads being flipped is 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and each outcome has an equal chance of occurring. In general, probability is used to calculate the likelihood of a certain event occurring, given the known probability of different outcomes. For example, if you roll a die, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, because there are 6 outcomes and each one has an equal chance of occurring. Probability can also be used to calculate the probability of a set of events occurring, given the known probability of each individual event. For example, if you roll a die twice and want to calculate the probability of rolling a 6 on both rolls, you would multiply the probability of rolling a 6 on the first roll (1/6) with the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll (1/6), giving you (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/36.
