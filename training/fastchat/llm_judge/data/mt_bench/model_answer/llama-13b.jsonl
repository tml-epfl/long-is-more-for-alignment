Remind yourself that the experience is happening now, not in the future.

Literature:\nWar and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published in 1869. The work is epic in scale and is regarded as one of the most important works of world literature. It is considered Tolstoy's finest literary achievement, along with his other major prose work Anna Karenina (1877).\nThe novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger between 1865 and 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869.\nTolstoy said that War and Peace was \"not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle\". Large sections, especially the later chapters, are a philosophical discussion rather than narrative. He also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel.\nThe novel is divided into four volumes, each volume containing several books. The first volume opens with the old Prince Bolkonsky's birthday party at his country estate. The guests include the Rostovs, the Bagrations, and the Kuragins. The novel's main characters are introduced: Pierre, Prince Andrei, and Natasha Rostov; Prince Andrei's sister, Princess Marya; and Boris, the eldest son of the old Prince Bolkonsky.\nThe second volume opens with the Rostovs' and Bolkonskys' preparations for the coming war. Pierre, who has been called to join the army, is sent to the front lines. The Rostovs and Bolkonskys are separated by the war.\nThe third volume opens with the Rostovs' and Bolkonskys' reunion in Moscow. Pierre is taken prisoner by the French. The Rostovs and Bolkonskys are reunited in Moscow.\nThe fourth volume opens with the Rostovs' and Bolkonskys' reunion in Moscow. Pierre is taken prisoner by the French. The Rostovs and Bolkonskys are reunited in Moscow.\n2. History:\nThe history of the United States is what happened in the past in the United States, a country in North America.

The wars were fought over the British desire to trade opium in China, which was illegal at the time. The wars were the first in a series of events that led to the end of the Qing dynasty and the beginning of the modern era in China.\nThe first Opium War began in 1839 when the British East India Company, which had a monopoly on the opium trade in India, tried to sell opium to China. The Chinese government, which had banned the import of opium, seized the opium and destroyed it. The British government demanded compensation for the opium, but the Chinese government refused. The British government sent a fleet of warships to China, and the two sides fought a series of battles. The British won the war, and China was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanking, which opened up five Chinese ports to British trade.\nThe second Opium War began in 1856 when the British government sent a fleet of warships to China to force the Chinese government to sign a new treaty. The Chinese government refused, and the two sides fought a series of battles. The British won the war, and China was forced to sign the Treaty of Tientsin, which opened up more Chinese ports to British trade."]}], "tstamp": 1685364069.2935662}
